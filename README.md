# Urban-Dataset

To submit a paper, we publicize our refined dataset

1. Urban sensor dataset
- you can check sensors location on Melbourne site (link: https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/Transport/On-street-Parking-Bay-Sensors/vh2v-4nfs)
- the dataset were categorized to 13 region level
- after aggregating 13 region (e.g., groupby), you can create sensor dataset on whole region 
- for 101 blocks granularity, due to the data size issue, it's impossible to upload it. if you need the dataset, contact me via email (mainthread@kaist.ac.kr)
2. Urban event dataset
- you can check where the events took place on Victoria traffic management site (link: http://victoria.snarl.com.au/incidents)
